Here is a table comparing **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Heap Sort**, and **Quick Sort** in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and other relevant characteristics:

| **Algorithm**   | **Best Case**    | **Average Case** | **Worst Case**      | **Space Complexity** | **Stable?** | **Notes**                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insertion Sort** | \( O(n) \)       | \( O(n^2) \)     | \( O(n^2) \)        | \( O(1) \)           | Yes         | Simple and efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.               |
| **Merge Sort**    | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n log n) \)    | \( O(n) \)           | Yes         | Divides array into halves and merges; good for large datasets.          |
| **Heap Sort**     | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n log n) \)    | \( O(1) \)           | No          | In-place sorting but not stable; uses a binary heap for sorting.        |
| **Quick Sort**    | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n log n) \) | \( O(n^2) \)        | \( O(log n) \)       | No          | Efficient with randomized pivot selection; worst-case can be mitigated. |

### **Key Notes**:

1. **Insertion Sort**:
    - Works best when the array is already or nearly sorted.
    - Inefficient for large datasets due to its \( O(n^2) \) average and worst-case performance.
    - Minimal space requirement (\( O(1) \)) makes it useful in memory-constrained environments.

2. **Merge Sort**:
    - Guarantees \( O(n \log n) \) in all cases.
    - Requires additional space proportional to the size of the input (\( O(n) \)).
    - Commonly used in external sorting (e.g., sorting data from a file).

3. **Heap Sort**:
    - In-place sorting with \( O(1) \) auxiliary space.
    - Not stable because of its heap property swaps.
    - Less commonly used compared to QuickSort and MergeSort in practical applications.

4. **Quick Sort**:
    - Often the fastest sorting algorithm in practice for average cases.
    - Worst-case performance (\( O(n^2) \)) occurs with poor pivot selection, but this can be mitigated by randomized pivoting or median-of-three methods.
    - Recursive; stack space can be reduced with tail-call optimization.
